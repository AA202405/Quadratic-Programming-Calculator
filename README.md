Quadratic Programming Solver üßÆ
A graphical tool to solve and visualize quadratic programming (QP) problems using KKT conditions.

‚úÖ Features
Solve Minimization or Maximization problems

Input matrices via an intuitive GUI

Supports up to 4 variables and 4 constraints

Visualizes constraints and optimal solution in 2D

Includes a Help window with usage instructions

Clean and user-friendly interface

üñ±Ô∏è How to Use
Enter number of variables (n) and constraints (m)

Click "Generate Matrices"

Fill in:

Matrix Q (quadratic terms)

Vector c (linear terms)

Matrix A and Vector b (constraints)

Select optimization mode: Minimize or Maximize

Click "Solve & Plot" to compute and visualize the result

‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes
Visual plotting is supported only for 2-variable problems

Solves using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system

Ideal for learning, teaching, or demonstrating QP concepts

Built using Python, Tkinter, and Matplotlib
